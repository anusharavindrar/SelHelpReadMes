# Bot Framework SDK Migration

The Bot Framework SDK v4 builds on the customers' feedback and learning experience from previous SDKs. The new version introduces the right levels of abstraction while enabling a flexible architecture of the bot components. This, for example, allows you to create a simple bot and then expand it in sophistication using the modularity and extensibility of the Bot Framework SDK v4.The Bot Framework SDK v4 supports the same underlying Bot Framework Service as v3. However, v4 is a refactoring of the previous SDKs to allow more flexibility and control over a bot's creation.
